# Introduction

YuliyOS is a Fedora IoT and Fedora CoreOS based distribution. It is meant to be
a useful addition for single board computer users. It tries to provide fully
working pre-configured images that you can provision on first boot. YuliyOS
takes away the maintenance of machines running it so the user can focus on
using it.
